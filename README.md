# Violin-Plots-LGBTQ-Indians

This repository provides violin plot visualization from data collected from 127 participants belonging to LGBTQ+ communities in India. The purpose of collecting this data was to investigate whether caste/religion-based minority status and plurisexuality affect ratings of participants on various psychological traits such as acceptance concerns, community connectedness, etc. In other words, this research aimed to examine the intersectional effects of caste/religion and plurisexuality on the identity of LGBTQ+ Indians.

## Violin Plots - Caste/Religion-Minority vs. No Minority:
1. Focuses on variables related to acceptance concerns, family connectedness, religiosity, community connectedness, and more.
2. Facet-wrapped by psychological subscales for easy comparison.
3. Color-coded by caste/religion-minority status.

## Violin Plots - Monosexual vs. Plurisexual:

1. Explores scores on psychological variables for individuals identifying as monosexual or plurisexual.
2. Facet-wrapped by psychological subscales for clear visualization.
3. Color-coded by sexual orientation.

## Additional Information on code:
1. Utilizes the gather function to reshape data and the convert_as_factor function to convert a variable to a factor.
2. Utilizes the viridis palette for enhanced visualization.
3. Defines custom labels for better interpretability.
